{"name":"RCSS","body":"# RCSS\r\n\r\n***Keep in mind that I am no CSS3 expert. My background is all in native development. This is an experiment, after all!***\r\n\r\n### About\r\nRCSS is a system built on top of Ruby to generate CSS animation using code that looks a lot like CoreAnimation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially, an animation is composed of a `duration`, a `delay`, some `options`, the actual `animation`, and a `completion` block.\r\nStructurally, this RCSS uses the style of `UIView#animateWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:`:\r\n```ruby\r\n  animation theDuration, theDelay, someOptions, -> {\r\n    # The animations\r\n  }, -> {\r\n    # The completion handler\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat makes this cool is the completion handler. Sure, you can write animations by hand. But what if you want to do something complex?\r\nI certainly don't want to write an animation with 20+ keyframes by hand when I can generate them with some code...\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's what makes RCSS ***awesome***.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe completion handler allows you to chain single animations together to make one, complex animation.\r\n**RCSS will generate the keyframe percentages and insert the rule changes** ***automatically.***\r\n\r\nSo, yeah that's pretty cool. But it gets betters. RCSS is Ruby. You can use anything you want in Ruby to generate animations.\r\nYou get the `Math` module and recursion **fo free!**\r\n\r\n\r\nTry it for yourself. It's awesome. I promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nRCSS depends on Ruby (1.9.3) and a WebKit-based browser (Other vender prefixes coming soon!).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n[@jparishy](https://twitter.com/jparishy) or [my blog](http://juliusparishy.com/).\r\n\r\n# License\r\nMIT License, Copyright (C) 2012\r\n","tagline":"Ruby+CSS=<3","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
